How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that

    I was in colorized line and with + or -

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can help me spot bugs, when somthing doesn't work as expected. Can help to revert back to working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros - it is flexible, and lets me decide where changes are related to one logical chunk.
    cons - it introduces more possibility to  "human error", 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because there are different intentions in this VCSes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log  - shows every commit that has been done (author of chenges, data, comments)
    git diff - shows differences with - + and colors, and with flag --stat, show statistics (added/deleted lines)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I always can switch back and use git diff to find problem.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git for my projects, to be more effecient and to collaborate with others

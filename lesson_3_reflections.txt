When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 When I wanna share my files with others or wanna have access to files from other machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 To have control over what changes I accept and what changes go to other branch, to merge it carefully or discard.
